## Introduction

This app was created in collaboration with Claire Castanet from the Northcoders Bootcamp. Together we created this app to fetch data from the NASA api:

https://data.nasa.gov/resource/gh4g-9sfh.json

Requests were made to this api using the Socrata Open Data API which itself takes SoQL requests for querying data. Using this request type we were able to access the neccesary data and display it in graph form.

Once hosted, feel free to take a look at years from 1880 until the modern day.
